## What is it?
The Stock Analysis Excel Add-In works with Excel to allow the user to search for potential stocks to invest in and quickly analyze them.  The purpose of this Add-In is to help the user select high performing stocks in order create a robust portfolio.

The program supports two functions:  

1. **Find Stocks**  
   It utilizes the Google Stock Screener to search for stocks based on predefined parameters that eliminate weak               candidates. 
 
2. **Analyze Stocks**  
   It acquires the financial data for a company and simplifies the stock analysis process by presenting the user with only the relevant information.

## Why use it?
Stock analysis can be a daunting task.  With access to a seemingly unlimited and sometimes contradictory amount of information about stocks, it leads to the reverse effect of preventing the investor from making a well-informed decision.

This program can help the user sort through the thousands of available stocks on the market and perform proper analysis.
